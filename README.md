# Event Management System

A robust and user-friendly web application built with Python and Django for managing and organizing events. This system allows users to browse upcoming events, register for them, and track their registrations, while providing administrators with a powerful dashboard to manage events and participants.

    *   Ability to categorize events for easy browsing.
    *   Search functionality to find specific events.
*   **Event Registration:**
    *   Authenticated users can register for any available event.
    *   A user can only register for a specific event once to prevent duplicate entries.
    *   The registration button is disabled if the user has already registered.
*   **Participant Dashboard:**
    *   A dedicated "My Registrations" page where users can view all the events they have registered for and see their status.
